## Naming With MBIDs

A naming script for Picard that makes extensive use of MusicBrainz IDs. Requires the "Additional Artist Variables" plugin to be installed `(Options > Options... > Plugins)`

Filenames which are too long get automatically truncated with fairly conservative defaults (~260). If you wish to raise (or lower) the limits then simply adjust the values after the `$len` functions accordingly.
